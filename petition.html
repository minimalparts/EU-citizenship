<h3>    Working towards a true EU citizenship</h3>

<p>Can we petition the European Commision and request a new law for an EU citizenship? No. EU citizenship is enshrined in European Treaties, i.e. in the texts that define how the member states of the Union have agreed to come together. The Commission cannot change those treaties -- its very existence depends on them. Instoring an EU citizenship means having new treaties between member states. In effect, it means building <b>a new Union</b>. No little feat.</p>

<p>Is it doomed then? No, absolutely not! Building a new Union is a political decision, which can be taken if enough of us push their governments to start the process. We must all work on understanding our institutions better and working out how we want them to change. The EU was built for business and markets. This has had economic advantages for all member states, but now is the time to remember that Europe is also a Europe of people. We must ask what would make our collective life better, and engage current institutions to help us in the process of rethinking the Union.</p>

<p>A good start is to petition the representatives of the European Union to make them aware that the people of Europe now feel the 
need for their identity to be recognised via a true EU citizenship, and to ask for help in collectively creating and implementing the idea. The draft of a petition text can be found
