<h3>What does it mean to be an EU citizen?</h3>

<p>For most of us, being a citizen of the EU means the same as being a citizen of any European nation. But there is in fact a fundamental difference between citizenship of a nation and citizenship of the EU: the latter is a derived status, which is only held in virtue of being a citizen of a member state. This does not only have practical consequences. It is also at odds with the felt identities of many Europeans.</p>

<p>The notion of EU citizenship is enshrined in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which states:</p>

<p>"1. Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship."</p>

<p>That is, there is no scope for pure European citizenship: the rights someone has as a European citizen are derived from their association with a member state. One consequence of this, which we are experiencing in the aftermath of Brexit, is that an EU citizen can be stripped of their citizenship in their country decides to break links with the EU.</p>

<p>One thing to note about Article 20 is that it is entirely unclear what exactly the notion of EU citizenship is good for. It seems that all rights conferred to so-called 'EU citizens' could have been conferred to 'citizens of EU member states'.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, free movement of persons across the EU has built a new form of identity: that of a European, more bound to the idea of Europe than to their legal ties to any member state. The last days have abounded with slogans such as 'I am notâ€¦ I am European'. It is time to take this feeling seriously and ask how the existing treaties of the European Union should be amended to reflect our new political and social situation.</p>

<p>EU citizenship shouldn't be a second-class citizenship anymore.</p>

<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>The first step seems to be to petition the European Commission to make it aware that the people of Europe now feel the need for their identity to be recognised in a true EU citizenship. The draft of a petition text is <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/eu-citizenship.txt">here</a>. Feel free to comment and contribute.</p>

<p>We intend to file the petition at once enough momentum has been gained for the idea. In order to keep track of supporters, we would be grateful if you followed <a href="https://twitter.com/allforEurope">@allforeurope</a> on twitter to indicate your willingness to be a signatory.</p>

<p>Talk to your friends, families, and strangers at bus stops. Give a clear, audible voice to the idea that we don't want less Europe, we want more.</p>
