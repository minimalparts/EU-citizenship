<h3>What does it mean to be an EU citizen?</h3>

<p>For most of us, being a citizen of the EU means the same as being a citizen of any European nation. 
But there is in fact a fundamental difference between citizenship of a nation and citizenship of the EU: 
the latter is a derived status, which is only held in virtue of being a citizen of a member state. 
This does not only have practical consequences: in 2016, it is also at odds with the felt identities of many Europeans.</p>

<p>The notion of EU citizenship is enshrined in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), 
which states:</p>

<p>"1. Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be 
a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship."</p>

<p>In its current form, this article leaves little scope for pure European citizenship: the rights someone has as a European 
citizen are derived from their association with a member state. One consequence of this, which we are experiencing in the 
aftermath of Brexit, is that an EU citizen can be stripped of their citizenship if their country decides to break links with 
the EU.</p>

<p>One further thing to note about Article 20 is that it is entirely unclear what exactly the notion of EU citizenship is good for. 
It seems that all rights conferred to so-called 'EU citizens' could have been conferred to 'citizens of EU member states'. 
The concept of an 'EU citizen' seems to have been a handy writing shortcut for the writers of the EU treaties, no more.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, free movement of persons across the EU has built a new form of identity: that of a European, more bound to 
the idea of Europe than to any particular member state. The last days have abounded with slogans such as 'I am not 
[insert nationality] I am European'. We believe it is time to take this feeling seriously and ask how the existing treaties of the European Union should be 
amended to reflect our new political and social situation.</p>

<p>EU citizenship shouldn't be a second-class citizenship anymore. Being direct citizens of Europe will help us make 
it the democracy it should have been long ago.</p>

<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>The first step is to petition the European Commission to make it aware that the people of Europe now feel the 
need for their identity to be recognised via a true EU citizenship. The draft of a petition text can be found
<a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/eu-citizenship.txt">here</a>. Feel free to comment and contribute.</p>

<p>To maximise chances of success, we intend to file the petition once enough momentum has been gained for the idea. 
In order to keep track of supporters, we would be grateful if you followed <a href="https://twitter.com/allforEurope">
@allforeurope</a> on twitter to indicate your willingness to be a signatory.</p>

<p>In the meantime, talk to your friends, families, and strangers at bus stops. Give a clear, audible voice to the idea that we 
don't want less Europe, we want more! Being fully recognized as citizens of the EU will also allow us to change the 
Union for the better.</p>
