          <h2>For a true EU citizenship</h2>

<p><b>For many of us across the EU, being European is more part of our identity than the specific member state printed on our passport. We are spread across 28 nations, but we know we belong together. Let's ask our governments to recognise us as what we are: citizens of Europe. And let's think about what we want our citizenship to be like.</b><br></p>

<h3>   What does it mean to be an EU citizen <i>now</i>?</h3>

<p>Intuitively, we might think that being a citizen of the EU means the same as being a citizen of any European nation. 
But there is in fact a fundamental difference between citizenship of a nation and citizenship of the EU: 
the latter is a derived status, which is only held by virtue of being a citizen of a member state. 
This does not only have practical consequences; it is also at odds with the felt identities of many Europeans.</p>

<p>The notion of EU citizenship is enshrined in Article 20(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), 
which states:</p>

<p>"Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be 
a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship."</p>

<p>This article makes clear that the concept of 'EU citizen', and the rights associated with it, are entirely derivative: they are
dependent on the association of an individual with a member state. One consequence of this, which we are experiencing in the 
aftermath of Brexit, is that an EU citizen can be stripped of their citizenship if their country decides to break links with 
the EU. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, free movement of persons across the EU has built a new form of identity: that of a European, more bound to 
the idea of Europe than to any particular member state. The last days have abounded with slogans such as 'I am not 
[insert nationality], I am European'. We believe it is time to take this feeling seriously and ask how the existing treaties of the European Union should be amended to reflect our new political and social situation. Or even better: create a proper European constitution
that would recognise our existence as Europeans.</p>

<p>EU citizenship shouldn't be a second-class citizenship anymore. Being direct citizens of Europe will help us make 
it the democracy it should have been long ago. It is notable that Brexit has made many pro-EU individuals start to voice their critique of the current European institutions. We know that in many ways, the EU is failing us as people. But walking away is not the solution. The solution is to now stand up, organise, and think carefully about what we want Europe to be.</p>


<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>Check out our <a href="petition.html">planned petition</a> to the Union representatives. Contribute to the text.</p>

<p>Get informed: what are your current rights as EU citizens? How would you like things to change? Let's not leave the creation of EU citizenship to bureaucrats! We must say loud and clear what we need. We'll try to record some of the <a href="eu-problems.html">current problems</a> Europeans experience when navigating the EU. Don't hesitate to share your stories on twitter -- we're at <a href="https://twitter.com/allforEurope">@allforEurope</a>.</p>

<p>Talk to your friends, families, and strangers at bus stops. In particular, talk to people from other member states and hear/share their stories. EU citizenship must be a common project.
