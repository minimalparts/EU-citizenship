          <h2>European problems</h2>

<p><b>European problems: those problems Europeans experience when navigating the EU, which could be solved with more Europe, more democracy, and a true EU citizenship.</b><br></p>

<h3>   Healthcare: one story out of many</h3>

<p>"EU regulations on free movement say that health care should be provided to any EU citizen in any EU country. For that purpose, the European health insurance card was created.</p>

<p>The problem is, European health insurance is all good for EU nationals who habitually live in one country and, from time to time, spend a little time in another (e.g. for a holiday or a work trip), but no more. In fact, if you fall sick in a country that is not your habitual residence, you will have to sign a form - before being treated - saying that you are only in that country for a short period of time (a few weeks).</p>

<p>This setup is totally unsuitable for proper Europeans who have permanent ties to several countries. In the last five years, I have been partly resident in Germany (where my partner lives), and partly working (and resident in) the UK and Italy, as well as Germany itself. I have had tremendous issues in getting health insurance, the most dramatic episode involving Germany and the UK playing pinball with me, each refusing to take responsibility for insuring me. I spent 18 months being effectively uninsured and when Germany eventually accepted defeat and recognised its responsibility, it made me pay 18 months of insurance in arrears, completely wiping out my savings. Two months later, I had a new job in Italy.</p>

<p>Italy was a new challenge and wanted to insure me on the basis of my (much higher) UK salary from two years before. This insurance would only cover me in the area of Italy I live in and I would, apparently, have to pay for extra insurance when I go and visit my partner in Germany. This seemed against basic EU regulations, but as many of us know, arguing with the administration of a member state is near impossible. I have now ended up with a private insurance from the UK, which does not cover me for all cases.</p>

<p>So when I see sites like <a href="http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/getting-the-facts-straight-eu-rights-to-reside-in-another-member-state-eu-benefit-claimants-and-nhs-treatment-entitlement/">EC in the UK</a> forced to explain that European regulations are set up so that people don't become a 'burden' to the country they wish to reside in, I am torn between tears and laughter. It is completely impossible to be a burden to anyone in the current EU setup if you are a true, free-moving European. On the contrary, the EU will probably abandon you on the grounds that you took free movement too seriously.</p>

<p>So when can I feel safe again, knowing that I will be insured for whichever medical condition I might have, by a true public European healthcare system?"</p>
