          <h2>European problems</h2>

<p><b>European problems: those problems Europeans experience when navigating the EU, which could be solved with more Europe, more democracy, and a true EU citizenship.</b><br></p>

<h3>   Residency: one story out of many</h3>

<p>"Do you get nervous when you hear the words 'habitual residence', 'permanent residence' or any suchlike? I do. I have on my keyring three keys for three houses in three different EU member states where I know I would feel welcome. One is near my work, one is where my partner lives, one is the house of a friend which I like calling 'home' too. On one I pay rent, on one I share running costs with 10 other people, one is just free. From both a financial and an emotional point of view, they all seem very 'habitual' to me.</p>

<p>Prior to Brexit, I considered several times applying for British, and then German nationality. But aside from various deep and less deep questions prompted by this idea, I realised that – given my several homes and my frequent work trips to other parts of the world – I would never satisfy residency requirements.</p>

<p>I know that many EU citizens are failing the residency requirements to get permanent status in their country(ies) of choice. This could be because there are too mobile, because they cannot satisfy stringent (and absurd) health insurance requirements, or for any other reason.</p>

<p>Why is it that being a true European, actively involved in the life of several member states, prevents you from being recognised rights and citizenship in those countries you contribute to? This, it seems, can only be solved by having an overarching citizenship which would acknowledge your involvement across the Union."</p>
